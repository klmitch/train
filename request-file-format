We need a way to describe requests to feed through Turnstile for the
benchmarking.  In the WSGI architecture, requests get turned into
simple environment dictionaries and a start_response call.  Since the
start_response call will come from the train architecture itself, we
only need the dictionaries.  One obvious way of representing the
request, then, is to simply use a JSON-serialized dictionary.  If we
go that way, though, we'll need a tool to help generate them.  An
alternative is a simpler dictionary containing the URI and headers,
and allow the train reader to synthesize the rest of the WSGI
environment.

One other requirement for the request descriptions is some means of
specifying time sequence of the requests; we want to be able to say
that one request must occur at some particular point in time.  (How we
implement this sequencing in train is also up for discussion; one
possibility is to simply fiddle with time.time(), but train is
multithreaded, which makes that more difficult; that means we'll need
a sequence generator to push requests into the request queue that is
used to feed train.)
